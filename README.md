# Introduction

**ReCalendar** is an application that allows the user to input their Canvas API token to then be returned with a full list of all of their assignments sorted by date, with the option to check if it has been done or not. The motivation for this program is to combine organization with a to-do list in hopes of including all course websites (in the future) that provide a student’s assignments. At this stage, Canvas is the only site supported, but our program provides better organization and a checklist.

# Technical Architecture



# Reinstallation

To reinstall this application, download all of the documents in this GitHub to your local code editor. In the “test-app” directory, run `npm install` and `npm start` in the terminal which will then pull up the site in a browser. From there, enter your Canvas API token which will then pull up a complete list of your assignments in Canvas sorted by date.
